      "name": "Does Capital Shield generate alpha or guarantee profits?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "No. Capital Shield is infrastructure software designed to reduce risk, not generate returns. It enforces deterministic execution constraints (max drawdown limits, regime guards, health checks) but makes no claims about profitability or alpha generation."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "A runaway algorithm is an automated trading system that continues executing trades beyond acceptable risk parameters, often leading to catastrophic losses. Capital Shield prevents this by enforcing hard limits (max drawdown, volatility thresholds) and blocking trades that violate predefined safety rules before they reach the market."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How does Capital Shield integrate with existing trading strategies?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Capital Shield is strategy-agnostic and integrates via REST API. Your trading strategy generates signals (BUY/SELL/HOLD), sends them to the Capital Shield API, which evaluates each signal against safety rails and returns an allow/block decision with structured rejection reasons."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is the difference between max drawdown protection and a stop-loss?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "A stop-loss is a reactive mechanism that exits a position after a loss occurs. Max drawdown protection in Capital Shield is proactive - it evaluates proposed trades BEFORE execution and blocks any trade that would cause total portfolio drawdown to exceed the configured threshold, preventing the loss from ever happening."
