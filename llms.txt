# Capital Shield

> Risk-first trading infrastructure for algorithmic trading systems. Strategy-agnostic, deterministic safety gates that sit between trading signals and market execution.

## About Capital Shield

Capital Shield is a deterministic safety layer for algorithmic trading. It does NOT generate trading signals or predict markets. It enforces hard risk limits (max drawdown, regime guards, health checks) with structured rejection reasons, providing a validation harness to measure the cost of safety before deployment.

**What it is:**
- Execution and risk gateway
- Deterministic safety rails
- Strategy-agnostic design
- Simulation/validation harness

**What it is NOT:**
- Not a trading strategy
- Not a signal generator
- Not financial advice
- No profit guarantees

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is Capital Shield a trading bot?**
No. It is risk-first trading infrastructure that sits between your strategy and execution. It does not generate buy/sell signals.

**Does it generate alpha or guarantee profits?**
No. It reduces risk and enforces deterministic execution constraints. It makes no claims about profitability.

**How does it integrate with trading strategies?**
Via REST API. Your strategy sends signals, Capital Shield evaluates against safety rails, returns allow/block decision with structured rejection reasons.

**What is a runaway algorithm?**
An automated trading system that continues executing trades beyond acceptable risk parameters, often leading to catastrophic losses. Capital Shield prevents this by blocking trades before execution.

**Why does risk-first architecture matter?**
It separates safety enforcement from signal generation, allowing validation of safety rails independently and measuring the cost of safety before deployment.
